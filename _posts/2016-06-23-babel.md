There are new versions of Javascript (ES6, ES7) full of [new features](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) and a ton of syntax shortcuts. For example:

```js
() =>
  2
```

...is shorthand for an anonymous function that returns 2.

As with everything in programming, people can't agree on anything and browsers are slow to implement stuff. We'd have jetpacks before browsers implemented it correctly/consistently so some cool people made some things called "transpilers" that convert ES6+ to usable old-fashioned Javascript (ES5). The most popular one is Babel.

[Here's](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?evaluate=true&lineWrap=false&presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-2&code=()%20%3D%3E%0A%20%202) what it converts the above code to.

Babel works with just about [any build process](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/), and is extendable with [modular plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/).

## How to use it

The easiest/cleanest way is installing some npm packages and configuring it in `package.json`. We'll make an npm script for it so we can run something like `npm run dev` from the terminal.

- `cd ~/playground/babel`
- `echo '{}' > package.json` (create a valid JSON file so we can `npm install` to it)
- `npm i -D babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-0` (this will install Babel's CLI, ES6 (aka: ES2015), and ES7 support)
- Add a `"babel"` object to `package.json`. Inside it we'll tell it to use the presets we installed:

```json
"babel": {
  "presets": [
    "es2015",
    "stage-0"
  ]
}
```

- Create a `test.js` file and put it in a `src` folder. `src` (sometimes `lib`) is your original code. We transpile stuff from `src` to the sibling `dist` folder.

> **Protip:** You transpile CSS (Sass, Stylus, LESS, PostCSS, etc.) and HTML (Pug/Jade, Haml, etc.) as well. Currently most companies organize this stuff as `src/css`, `src/js`, `src/html`, etc. but I think [component architecture](http://ecss.io/chapter5.html) is a better solution for larger projects so try it out if you can.

- Now run `node_modules/.bin/babel src -d dist` to ensure ES6/7 files in `src` are being transpiled to vanilla Javascript in the `dist` folder.
- If you run `node_modules/.bin/babel -h` you'll see it has a watch flag.
- Run `node_modules/.bin/babel -w src -d dist` and change some stuff in `src/test.js` to make sure it's being transpiled on saves.
- Now... it'll suck to have to type all that crap every time so add it to the `"scripts"` object in `package.json` as `"dev"` then just run `npm run dev` (`package.json` scripts don't need the `node_modules/.bin/` part).
- You can add/nest extra files in `src` and everything will work fine.

`package.json` should look like this (if you copy this make sure you run `npm i` before using it):

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-cli": "^6.10.1",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.9.0",
    "babel-preset-stage-0": "^6.5.0"
  },
  "babel": {
    "presets": [
      "es2015",
      "stage-0"
    ]
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "babel -w src -d dist"
  }
}
```

## Congrats

Now you're able to use ES6/7. Not only that, but you're using `package.json` scripts to perform tasks which is [pretty nice](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/) as long as a CLI for a particular tool is available (if one isn't, consider doing everyone a favor and [making one](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow)).

## Homework

- Learn ES6/7. It's awesome and will make your code much more elegant.
  - [https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)
  - [http://www.2ality.com/](http://www.2ality.com/) (amazing tutorials)
- Learn how to use [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all) to watch/transpile Babel and Sass at the exact same time and consider completely replacing Gulp/Grunt with npm scripts.
  - Make Sass output source maps to `dist/css/maps` folder.
  - Make Sass build everything in `src/css` before it watches.
