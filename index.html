      <h3>Pertinent Skills</h3>

      <div class="skills" id="masonry">
        <div class="skill">
          <h4>HTML</h4>

          <progress value="90" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I could use some more work on ARIA roles, <a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank">microdata</a>, localStorage, but I'm generally very good at HTML.
          </p>

          <p>
            I understand semantic markup and actually have a <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/boy" target="_blank">lightweight HTML boilerplate</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/boy-npm" target="_blank">CLI</a> that works well with a plethora of browsers by default (saves a lot of time on browser testing).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>CSS</h4>

          <progress value="95" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I'm insane at CSS, preprocessors, and PostCSS. This sounds like a silly skill to brag about, but bulletproof CSS architecture is a really valuable skill to have.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Example #1:</b> Reflow is one of the most <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2009/03/27/reflows-repaints-css-performance-making-your-javascript-slow/" target="_blank">annoying things</a> in the universe and a problem to this day. I created a <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/intrinsic" target="_blank">mixin</a> that fixes it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Example #2:</b> Redesigning a production site without breaking anything is <i>very</i> difficult. I did it on a monumental codebase with <a href="https://teespring.com" target="_blank">Teespring</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Example #3:</b> Browser support. Everyone gets this wrong and when they try to fix one browser, they break things in another. Someone well-versed in CSS is familiar with a lot of common gotchas and can save a lot of time by avoiding them. I can literally write a dozen more ROI examples upon request.
          </p>

          <p>
            I created one of the <a href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=stylus&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93" target="_blank">most popular</a> Stylus projects, and one of the <a href="https://js.coach/postcss?sort=popular" target="_blank">most popular</a> PostCSS projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've read and understand most CSS architectures (SMACSS, BEM, ECSS). I also know CSS Modules are the best thing ever.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>JavaScript</h4>

          <progress value="85" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I'm good at jQuery, vanilla JavaScript, AJAX, and consuming APIs.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/postcss-ant" target="_blank">ES6+</a>; functional concepts like mapping, reducing, etc.; promise usage to avoid pyramids of doom; some design patterns; code style with ESLint &amp; Prettier (StandardJS is currently my favorite flavor); strong typing with Flow/TypeScript; and modularizing code with imports/exports.
          </p>

          <p>
            ðŸš¨ I won't be able to pass your "Explain how prototypal inheritance and <code>this</code> binding works." I've studied it and could probably explain it if you put me on the spot, but I forget it and still bump into it in weird places from time-to-time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>React.js</h4>

          <progress value="40" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've been studying React.js and Vue <i>a lot</i> lately.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've only made a few simple things, but understand the core concepts (state, props, refs, ES6, functional components, Redux) well and can create builds with a variety of tools (create-react-app, Webpack, Rollup, Browserify, etc.).
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm excited to finally master one of these.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Node.JS</h4>

          <progress value="75" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've built <b>a lot</b> of custom stuff with Node. It's one of my favorite things to do. I'm very familiar with the API and at least know what standard libs to search through for answers to particular questions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've used streams and spun up simple HTTP servers/CRUD APIs with Express, but I wouldn't consider myself super comfortable with them yet.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>WordPress</h4>

          <progress value="85" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've worked with WP for several years. I can write custom plugins with it and have lead development on WP sites with millions of monthly visitors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Right now I'm focusing on <a href="/writings/2017/php/wp-components">inventing</a> a really nice workflow using a few plugins (ACF mostly) and getting better with the REST API.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Rails, Django, Laravel</h4>

          <progress value="35" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've studied the languages underneath these frameworks, and have worked on a few professional projects with Rails and Django, but wouldn't consider myself proficient in these.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently very interested in Laravel just because it has some nice official tools. I'm just using it to grok working with ActiveRecord in an OOP environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            I grok most of the cooncepts. I just need to sit down and build a few things with it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Design</h4>

          <progress value="80" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I started my career doing design. It comes pretty naturally to me. I'm comfortable in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch--pretty much any Adobe CC product comes easily to me (I've tinkered with After Effects).
          </p>

          <p>
            I haven't spent a lot of time with these tools since responsive web-design became a hot topic. Nowadays I prefer to prototype directly in the browser.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a lot of knowledge of typography, general design concepts (things like the rule of thirds, contrast and flow, etc.) and I'm especially good at <a href="https://dribbble.com/corysimmons" target="_blank">mixing code with design</a> to do things like work with ratios.
