    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        This site was designed with a golden ratio grid using a <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/postcss-ant" target="_blank">PostCSS layout plugin</a> I made that mimics much of CSS Grid Spec but works seamlessly in IE9; developed with Jekyll because the billion static-site generators made me dizzy ðŸ¤•; and deployed to Netlify (SSL, HTTP2 &amp; CDN perf).

      <h3>Pertinent Skills</h3>

      <div class="skills">
        <div class="skill">
          <h4>HTML</h4>

          <progress value="90" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I could use some more work on ARIA roles, <a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank">microdata</a>, localStorage, but I'm generally pretty good at this.
          </p>

          <p>
            I understand semantic markup and actually have a <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/boy" target="_blank">lightweight spin-off</a> of HTML boilerplate that works well with a plethora of browsers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>CSS</h4>

          <progress value="95" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I have a really deep knowledge of CSS, preprocessors, and PostCSS.
          </p>

          <p>
            I created one of the <a href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=stylus&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93" target="_blank">most popular</a> Stylus projects, and one of the <a href="https://js.coach/postcss?sort=popular" target="_blank">most popular</a> PostCSS projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've read and understand most CSS architectures (SMACSS, BEM, ECSS). Unpopular opinion, but I think Atomic CSS is the most interesting and misunderstood concept in CSS in the past several years.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>JavaScript</h4>

          <progress value="80" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I'm good at jQuery, vanilla JavaScript, AJAX, and consuming APIs.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know ES6+; functional concepts like mapping, reducing, etc.; promise usage to avoid pyramids of doom; some design patterns; code style with ESLint (StandardJS is currently my favorite flavor); strong typing with Flow/TypeScript; and modularizing code with imports/exports.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>React.js</h4>

          <progress value="40" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've been studying React.js <i>a lot</i> lately.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've only made a few simple things, but understand the core concepts (state, props, refs, ES6, functional components, Redux) well and can create builds with a variety of tools (create-react-app, Webpack, Rollup, Browserify, etc.).
          </p>

          <p>
            I need to work on some real projects to thoroughly grok it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Node.JS</h4>

          <progress value="75" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've built a lot of custom tools with Node. It's one of my favorite things to do. I'm very familiar with the API and at least know what standard libs to search through for answers to particular questions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've used streams and spun up HTTP servers/CRUD APIs with Express, but I wouldn't consider myself super comfortable with them yet.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>WordPress</h4>

          <progress value="85" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've worked with WP for several years. I can write custom plugins with it and have lead development on WP sites with millions of monthly visitors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Right now I'm focusing on <a href="/writings/2017/php/wp-components">inventing</a> a really nice workflow using a few plugins (ACF mostly) and getting better with the REST API.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Rails, Django, Laravel</h4>

          <progress value="25" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've studied the languages underneath these frameworks, and have worked on a few professional projects with Rails and Django, but wouldn't consider myself proficient in these.
          </p>

          <p>
            I understand the concepts behind them (MVC, OOP, etc.), but just don't have a ton of real-world experience doing backend development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm really interested in building APIs with some of these technologies and consuming them with React.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Design</h4>

          <progress value="75" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I started my career doing design. It comes pretty naturally to me. I'm comfortable in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch--pretty much any Adobe CC product comes easily to me (I've tinkered with After Effects).
          </p>

          <p>
            I haven't spent a lot of time with these tools since responsive web-design became a hot topic. Nowadays I prefer to prototype directly in the browser.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a lot of knowledge of typography, general design concepts (things like the rule of thirds, contrast and flow, etc.) and I'm especially good at mixing code with design to do things like work with ratios.
          </p>
