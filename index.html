      <p>
        This site was designed with a golden ratio grid using a <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/postcss-ant" target="_blank">PostCSS layout plugin</a> I made that mimics much of CSS Grid Spec but works seamlessly in IE9; developed with Jekyll because the billion static-site generators made me dizzy ðŸ¤•; and deployed to Netlify (SSL, HTTP2, CDN) with DNSimple.

      <h3>Pertinent Skills</h3>

      <div class="skills">
        <div class="skill">
          <h4>HTML</h4>

          <progress value="90" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I could use some more work on ARIA roles, <a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank">microdata</a>, localStorage, but I'm generally pretty good at this.
          </p>

          <p>
            I understand semantic markup and actually have a <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/boy" target="_blank">lightweight spin-off</a> of HTML boilerplate that works well with a plethora of browsers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>CSS</h4>

          <progress value="95" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I have a really deep knowledge of CSS, preprocessors, and PostCSS.
          </p>

          <p>
            I created the 3rd <a href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=stylus&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93" target="_blank">most popular</a> Stylus project, and the 4th <a href="https://js.coach/postcss?sort=popular" target="_blank">most popular</a> PostCSS project.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've read, and understand, most CSS architectures, and none of them have me 100% sold. Unpopular opinion, but I think Atomic CSS is the most interesting concept in CSS in the past several years.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>JavaScript</h4>

          <progress value="75" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I'm really good at vanilla JavaScript, but don't have a lot of real-world experience with JS frameworks. I'm currently studying React/Redux and can whip together some simple stuff, but I believe developers don't really get good at a technology until they've used it on a few large, real-world, projects in the wild.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know ES6+; functional concepts like mapping, reducing, etc.; promise usage to avoid pyramids of doom; some design patterns; code style with ESLint (StandardJS is currently my favorite flavor); strong typing with Flow/TypeScript; modularizing code with imports/exports; etc.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Node.JS</h4>

          <progress value="80" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've built a lot of custom tools with Node. It's one of my favorite things to do. I'm very familiar with the API and at least know what standard libs to search through for answers to particular questions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've used streams and spun up HTTP servers/APIs with Express, but I wouldn't consider myself super comfortable with them yet. I'm currently working on this.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>WordPress</h4>

          <progress value="85" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've worked with WP for several years. I can write custom plugins with it and have lead development on WP sites with millions of monthly visitors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Right now I'm focusing on <a href="/writings/2017/php/wp-components">inventing</a> a really nice workflow using a few plugins (ACF mostly) and getting better with the REST API.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Laravel</h4>

          <progress value="20" max="100"></progress>

          <p>
            I've watched a ton of videos on it and I'm anxious to play with it, but I haven't had much time to work with it. I've worked with Rails and Django in the past. It seems identical to Rails in many ways so it shouldn't be too hard to learn.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would love an entry-level position really getting my hands dirty with Laravel.
