    <p>
      This site was designed with a golden ratio grid using a <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/postcss-ant" target="_blank">PostCSS layout plugin</a> I made that mimics much of CSS Grid Spec but works seamlessly in IE9; developed with Jekyll because the billion static-site generators made me dizzy ðŸ¤•; and deployed to Netlify (speed, CDN) with DNSimple (ALIAS records for apex domain) in less than a day.
      Almost all the articles were written in that same day using GitHub's built-in editor to paste screenshots.
